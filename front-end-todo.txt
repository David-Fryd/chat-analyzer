Some todos/remidners when developing the front-end:

Header dropdown named "Analyze"
    # op1: Process
        # "Before visualizing the data, have to ...."
    # op2: Visualize
        # "Aftering processing the data, visualize it with the chart system!"


When re-process is supported,  detail, add a pros/cons to using each strategy.
    C-download then our software separately:
      - Pros: Run very different analysis styles on the raw data quickly without having to re-download
      - Cons: Raw data takes up a bunch of space, and is not necessary for all use cases
    Integrated C-download (recommended & default):
      - Pros: Only store what you need on your machine
      - Cons: Can only re-post-process for spikes and other data, but sample size is fixed without a re-download


Ensure in CLI builder with chatfile mode that these settings are reflected:
chat_download_settings =  {
      "url" : url,
      "message_types" : 'all'
  }
