# Chat Analyzer TODO

Some Todos have associated places in the codebase where a comment exists with the TODO's hash, making it easy to find/location the parts in the code that have already been identified as associated with the TODO.

## High Priority
- Standardize logging/printing of info/output/error messages
- Print output destination on completion
- In addition to regular & integrated processing, add 2 modes:
  - Add option/flag to re-process a local output file for spikes
  - Add option to specificy input chat-downloaded file (helpful for analysis of diff sample lengths)

## Medium Priority

## Low Priority
- Control message types that we analyze/download based on CLI. (chat_analyzer.py TODO#56ab7)

## In the future...
