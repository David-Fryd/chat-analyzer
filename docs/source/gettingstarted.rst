Getting Started
===================================

Welcome to the getting started guide for Chat Analyzer! In this guide, 
we'll cover the basics of how to use the software, some intermediate and advanced uses, 
and overall best practices when using the software.



Usage modes & Source
---------------------

In its simplest form, this software outputs information about a chatlog associated with a livestream.
Regardless of the mode that is used, the output file format is the same (More details under :doc:`Output Specification </output>`).

url
**********

The default mode, ``url`` mode ...


chatfile
**********

``chatfile`` mode ...


reanalyze
**********

``reanalyze`` mode ...


.. .. code:: console

..     TODO: Discuss modes:
..     url:...
..     chatfile: JSON from Xenova\'s chat-downloader to JSON analytic data to be used for visualization (or -sc)
..     reanalyze:...

Examples
--------

TODO: add...

.. This will eventually describe a standard user flow, when to reanalyze, when to url, when its good to save chatfile, etc...

.. For now, just reference :doc:`Command Line Interface </cli>`

.. visualizer will have better results for youtube if you use the share link thats youtu.be

.. (remember to update the link in the README.rst if we remove cli and replace it with getting started...)
