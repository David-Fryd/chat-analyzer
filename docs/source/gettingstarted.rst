Getting Started
===================================

This will eventually describe a standard user flow, when to reanalyze, when to url, when its good to save chatfile, etc...

For now, just reference :doc:`Command Line Interface </cli>`

(remember to update the link in the README.rst if we remove cli and replace it with getting started...)
